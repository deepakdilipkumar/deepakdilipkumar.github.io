Hi! I'm Deepak, from Chennai in India. I completed a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2016, and I've just [finished](http://ml.cmu.edu/news/news-archive/2017/december/celebrating-mld-december-2017-graduates.html) my MS in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I'll be joining the User Modeling and Ads Targeting Team at Twitter in San Francisco from February!
